# Algorithm & Process Optimization Skill

Systematic workflow to improve algorithms or process flows using real input data and target metrics, without harming already-good performance.

## When to Use
- Optimizing an algorithm or multi-step process against clear metrics
- Improving confidence, accuracy, precision, recall, latency, or similar KPIs
- Diagnosing why some cases perform poorly
- Iteratively fixing weak cases while protecting strong ones

## When Not to Use
- No input dataset or no measurable metric
- Pure conceptual discussion without evaluation data
- One-off code cleanup unrelated to performance/quality metrics

## Required Inputs
- Input dataset (or representative samples)
- Target metrics to optimize (e.g. confidence score, accuracy, F1, error rate)
- Current algorithm/process to evaluate
- Definition of "low performance" threshold when available

## Optimization Loop

### Step 1: Run Baseline
- Run the algorithm/process on the input data
- Collect outputs and metric values for each case

### Step 2: Evaluate Performance
- Compute overall metrics
- Rank or segment cases by performance

### Step 3: Filter Low Performance
- Isolate cases below the accepted threshold
- Keep high-performance cases as a regression guardrail

### Step 4: Classify Failure Cause
For each low-performance group, classify:

- **Input data issue** (noise, labeling error, missing fields, invalid format)
  → Document and report; do not force algorithm changes for bad data
- **Algorithm / process issue**
  → Continue to Step 5

### Step 5: Deep Analysis
- Investigate root causes in the algorithm/process
- Identify failure patterns (edge cases, feature gaps, brittle rules, weak models, bad thresholds, pipeline order issues)
- Search for candidate fixes (logic changes, features, parameters, alternative methods)

### Step 6: Plan Safe Improvements
- Propose targeted fixes for the weak cases
- Explicitly check risk to already-good cases
- Prefer changes that are localized, testable, and reversible
- Define success criteria before implementing

### Step 7: Implement, Re-run, and Verify
- Apply the planned improvement
- Re-evaluate on:
  1. Previously low-performance cases
  2. Previously good-performance cases (regression check)
- Outcomes:
  - Improved and no major regression → proceed to Step 8
  - Not improved or unclear → return to Step 4/5 with new evidence
  - Regression on good cases → revise or roll back the change

### Step 8: Report
Produce a structured report covering:
- Baseline setup and metrics
- Low-performance analysis and cause classification
- Improvements attempted and rationale
- Before/after results
- Residual risks and next steps

## Guardrails
- Never optimize only on failing cases without checking healthy cases
- Separate data quality issues from algorithm issues
- Prefer incremental, evidence-based changes over large rewrites
- Stop when metric targets are met or gains are no longer worth the complexity

## Related Skills
- Use **tech-research** when better algorithms, methods, or SOTA options are needed.
- Use **data-scientist** for deeper statistical analysis, segmentation, or metric diagnosis.
- Use **python-performance-optimization** when the bottleneck is runtime, memory, or I/O efficiency.
- Follow **antigravity-reporting** for the final before/after optimization report.
